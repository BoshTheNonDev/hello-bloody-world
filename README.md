This is a time-honored tradition in computer programming on Git hub. Streuth and bloody !

I much like Security, OSINT, Python, JavaScript and much other things! Good, no !

I worked on muchness to nothings, in one experiment it create 256K users to a something of nothing in 52 days !  This makes it so peoples bite at knees, one a codeman who speaks false about javascript and security.  SO, BoshTheNonDev say... how you say... "Get Stuffed To Learn Other Things Of Codeness - Okay !".  

I am here now.
